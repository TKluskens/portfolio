            <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              Imagine trying to build a dynamic website with a team that barely
              speaks your language, sounds like a challenge, right? Well, I did
              exactly that during my internship in Italy, where I developed a
              site that visualized complex data for clients, overcoming language
              barriers and technical barriers alike.
            </p>            <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              I am Tom Kluskens, a student in Applied Information Technology at
              University of Applied Sciences and Arts Ghent, and I bring
              experience in backend development. I&apos;ve built multiple web
              applications, worked with APIs, and delivered projects under tight
              deadlines. Whether it&apos;s JavaScript or Python, I adapt fast
              and learn even faster.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              Beyond coding, I know how to collaborate and communicate‚Äîwhether
              in a fast-paced team or across cultural differences. Years of
              playing basketball taught me teamwork, while my internship abroad
              sharpened my problem-solving skills in real projects.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              My passion for technology extends beyond development‚ÄîI&apos;ve
              configured and maintain my own Ubuntu media server at home, and I
              enjoy reading comics in my free time. I love exploring both the
              practical and creative sides of computing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              In short, I bring the technical skills, adaptability, and teamwork
              needed to drive backend projects forward. If you&apos;re looking
              for a backend developer who delivers results and integrates
              seamlessly into your team, let&apos;s talk!
